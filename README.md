# QualysSSLCheckviaPS

## what?
You don't want to check all your TLS certificates on ssllabs.com in your browser? Use this shitty Powershell script i wrote, put in all the hostnames and leave it running for x minutes. After it has finished, you have a CSV report of the certificate's grade. You're welcome.

## why?
The intention was plain laziness. I put it on github because some fella on reddit said i should.

## ok?
No warranty, no support, yadayada
